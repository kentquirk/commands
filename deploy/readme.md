# deploy

This folder contains files that are used in circle for building and testing all of the go source code.

## Special files

`known_hosts` - This file is generated by running the command: `ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com`. The output of which can be directly stored into ~/.ssh/known_hosts. Any difference between what is stored here will be rejected by dep when attempting to clone dependencies.

## Circle CI builds

There are three modes regarding git tags and git branches that are captured in `./circleci/config.yml`, and each triggers different actions.

Firstly, all commits run the build job (which also runs unit tests in all `oneiro-ndev` repos under the `commands` vendor directory).

Secondly, tagged builds respond to commits that are tagged. See the README at the root of this repo for information on supported tags. They are useful for running "catchup", "integration", "push" and "deploy" jobs specifically.

The third case is a commit to master, this will run all steps and deploy to devnet.
