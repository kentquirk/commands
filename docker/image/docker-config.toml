[Features]
  # Block heights at which features becomes active.  Add more feature heights here as needed.
  # User code uses app.IsFeatureActive("FeatureName") to know whether a given feature is active.
  #
  # Typically we add new features and assign a "future" height to them.  We can change them just
  # before deploying to mainnet.  But in no case should we change any heights in this section
  # that are less than or equal to mainnet's current height, since those features need old logic
  # for playback compatibility.
